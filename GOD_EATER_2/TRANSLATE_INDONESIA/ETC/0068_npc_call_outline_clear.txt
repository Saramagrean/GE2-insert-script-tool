Let Alisa partake in the free mission
to deepen your bond with her

Satellite bases are on the increase
apparently thanks to Alisa's proposal
Seeing how she takes up the job for the civillians' sake
all by herself without any complaints, Kouta feels like
she is acting as "the branch director's vesse
---------------------------------------------------------
[0000]
Alisa, arranging the  
preparations to sweep the area of 
Aragami around the area of the satellite wreckage, is driven by duty and as

leader will take responsibility to go to the area and take a second look. 
It is impossible 
now for the inhabitants to return to the area,
I will do my best to keep the current situation in hand as much as I can
---------------------------------------------------------
[0000]
Let Alisa partake in the free mission
to deepen your bond with her

Alisa finally got her Blood Arts awaken
She is overjoyed that she is able to
fight on par with Invasive Species 
In order to help her
Let's work with her more in the future
---------------------------------------------------------
[0000]
Alisa accepted a mission to subjugate Aragami at the old dam,
but it seems that some problem emerged
Go and ask Alisa about it in detail

Alisa is bad with cleaning her room
She was keen on doing better next time
but apparently she shows little confidence, unlike her usual self
You now see Alisa in a new light
---------------------------------------------------------
[0000]
Regarding the construction of the satellite.
It seems we need to cooperate and ensure materials and mankind's hope.
Go talk to Alisa ensuring materials and keep the construction schedule on time. There are not enough people to help with the construction.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0000]
It seems there have been rare species sightings around the satellite 
Alisa is concerned that the satellite is in danger
Ready, let's go with Alisa to the satellite

If the rare species is seen, 
There is no fear of being attacked.Alisa seems to have received a generous reward from residents for thus mission.
I feel that my bond with Alisa has deepened significantly

Ciel wants to report the findings of the "Blood Bullet" which was found previously by the maintenance team.

The Blood Bullet is a module found to possess a "certain property" due to a mutation.

Ciel has a special feeling about it, so she has decided to study it side by side with the maintenance team.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0001]
In order to understand more, it seems that
Ciel has tested Bullet Editing with every Gun Barrel.
She now appears wanting to progress onto inspecting the variations of the Blood Bullet.

The test results confirmed great success
in Blood Bullet editing, Improving the
field of sensitivity in the battlefield.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0001]
Ciel's Blood Bullet development has made some progress but
It seems like she's being stuck.
Let's confirm it with Ciel.

With Ciel's research, the Blood Bullet's
Mutation Module extraction succeeded
Blood Bullet modification is now possible.
We promised that from now on, we will continue on the research together.

For the improvement of tactical and combat strategy,
Ciel is researching for reference material

She couldn't find anything.
Let's hear what Ciel has to say.
Ciel, who wants to know more about the captain, said
「If I could breakdown the analysis......」

[0003]
Let's accompany Emil in a free mission

Emil who has been put in charge of Satelite Immigration Escort Duty
seems quite nervous....will he be okay...

Having safely completed the mission,
Emil seems to have felt his own growth.
He wants to be like the "Northern Star" who guides the people,
That is his dream and also the origin of the name given to his God Arc.
You feel your bond with Emil has deepened greatly.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0003]
Placed on Transport Guard duty, Emil
feigns a calm composure and yet his face
shows no sign of calm complexion.
Go and see how he is holding up.

Emil has grown greatly, aqcuiring new abilitites.

Let's accompany Erina in a free mission
to deepen our bond

The surly word Erina left behind
「……not bad」
probably is her honest feeling
However, Erina expression still stiff
---------------------------------------------------------
[0004]
Erina seems to have something to ask for.
Let's listen to her story in detail.

In order not to become a burden for Captain Kota and the rest of the Far East Branch,
Erina is exerting effort in becoming mature. 
「I'd like to see even just a bit of your combat style for reference.」
 Erina's facial expression while asking me was a bit soft.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0004]
Immediately, Erina is seems like to ask the cooperation of the Mission
Is ready, we will heading to the place of Erina

I heard the story of a brother who martyrdom three years ago from Erina
Soma also seemed to feel the responsibility now to brother's death
To excessive concern for Erina
That she he himself is puzzled
At the request of Erina, on the next mission Soma was supposed to accompany
---------------------------------------------------------
[0004]
It seems that you will be going on a mission with Soma
During your previous conversation, you made a promise to accompany him.
Finish your preperationsand head over to where Erina is.

Even though there was a difference in opinions with Soma
You felt a glimpse of Erina's growth as a God Arc user.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0004]
Let Erina partake in the free mission
to deepen your bond with her

Erina prided herself on being a Far East God Eater
so it seems she has harboured a strong sense
of rivalry against Blood
Now that all the ill feelings are resolved
she is going to call you her "Senior"
---------------------------------------------------------
[0004]
You allowed Erina to accompany you on the free mission

Erina is looking for someone to accompany
her so as to confirm the signal of what might be
an Inducive Type near the Satellite.
Get ready, and head to where Erina is.

Despite the dangerous situation,
Erina managed to remain calm and assess the situation, Protecting Emil successfully.

With some sort of plan in mind, you
hear a rumor that Instructor Kanon is looking for you.
Head over to Kanon and hear what she has to say.

Although she is a user of an old-model barrel gun, 
there is much instability in her shooting skill and she also views this as a problem.
The most pressing issue is how to fix her accidentally firing the gun...
---------------------------------------------------------
[0006]
Kanon joins you on the free mission.
Strengthen your bonds with her.

During her time as a new recruit, Kanon was part of the 'Defense Unit'
Because of her bad compatability she was banned
from the Oracle Reserve. That may be the reason
she is always indecisive.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0006]
Once the verdict on whether Kanon's Oracle Reserve ban
is lifted or not is out, go and interview her.

Because of Recovery orbs, the effect of a misfire is slightly smaller
Licca also gave her approval for the use of the
Oracle Reserve, resulting in a very happy Kanon.
Expect great growth from Kanon from now on.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0006]
Let Canon partake in the free mission
to deepen your bond with her

Since receiving the guidance from Coach
it seems that Canon's performance got improved leaps and bounds
She found out the role of a combat medic
There is a spark in Canon's eyes
---------------------------------------------------------
[0006]
Kanon joins you on the free mission.
Strengthen your bonds with her.

The recovery orb suddenly got stuck in the barrel
Kanon succumbed to anxiety..
However, that allowed the manifestation
of the Blood Bullet.
You can expect even greater growth from her.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0006]
Kanon joins you on the free mission.
Strengthen your bonds with her.

Kanon talks about how she sees her greatest contribution
is having blown away Aragami.
Because of that strong will, she was able to 
manifest her Super Steam-powered Blood Bullet.
That seems to be just how she is.
You feel your bond with Kanon has deepened greatly.

Kota joins you on the free mission.
Strengthen your bonds with him.

After the mission, you grab a bite at the lounge.
Since Mutsumi was assigned to the Far East Branch,
the lounge has gotten quite lively.
It seems that he will show you all the 
'Good Spots' around the Far East Branch.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0007]
You allowed Kota to accompnay you on the free mission
Try and deepen your bonds with him.

Over the course of a few years, thanks to comms. technology
The survival rate for God Arc users increased exponentially,
in addition they were also able to  aqcuire much new information.
Over at Unit 1 it seems they are having problems with this,
I wonder if they'll be okay?
---------------------------------------------------------
[0007]
There have been confimed sightings of Aragami 
around the Far East Branch area, Kota is currently
looking for someone to help him in a subjugation mission.
Finish your preperations and head over to Kota.

The exterior residential distract that extends around
the Far East Branch is apparently where Kota's family
live. As Kota talks of his home, you can see how proud he is of it.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0007]
Let Kota partake in the free mission
to deepen your bond with him

Unable to stop the quabble between Erina and Emil
Kota lost his confidence
as their captain
but he acknowledged their own quirks
and he is finding a way to manage 1st unit little by little
---------------------------------------------------------
[0007]
It seems that something is wrong with Kota's bullets,
he is requesting support.
Head over to Kota to see what is going on.

It seems the root of the problem was something 
to do with the Blood Bullet manifestation.
Even though it was an old model, he didn't 
spare any effort in dealing with it. Seeing Kota like that, you
feel you saw his pride as a God Arc user.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0007]
You allowed Kota to accompany you on the free mission.
Try to deepen your bonds with him.

As the captain of Unit 1, alongside working, 
You notice that Kota is also endevouring to solve 
problems in the exterior residential district.
When you look at him it becomes clear that
he really loves this place.
You feel you bond with Kota has deepened greatly.

and she wants to unveil it straight away
Go to Nana and check out what she has made.

She has perfected the 'Nana Deluxe Trap'

She has become quite competant in handling traps as well.
It seems like her creative work will continue just fine.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0008]
You allowed Nana to accompany you on the free mission.
Try to deepen your bond with her.

Cramed with every SEAL selected food item
the 'Nana Deluxe Health Ration' became a huge
hit in every branch after gaining support from many
of the females.

'Nana Deluxe Trap Mk.II'
It ended in a great success (?!) as it
managed to lure out a large number of Gboro-Gboro....
---------------------------------------------------------
[0008]
You allowed Nana to accompany you on the free mission.
Try to deepen your bond with her.

Since a time forgotten to memories of the past,
since waking up to the 'Power of Blood', little by little
she begins to remember it.
You can see Nana's facial expression light up as she talks about it.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0008]
It seems Nana has another creation for unveiling.
Go to Nana and check out what she has made.

A multicoloured large flower flutters under the night sky, 
it was named the 'Fluttering Grenade'.
With it in hand, as a 'mark of gratitude' Nana
expresses a whole hearted smile.
You feel your bond with Nana has deepened greatly.

Licca wants to test out the deivice straight away.
Finish your preperations and head over to Licca.

The prototype was originally part of Licca's 
father's research but when he died, 
Licca took over the research, aiming for a more practical use
in the field.
It seems her research will continue just fine.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0009]
Licca is requesting help for testing the adjusted prototype
after taking onboard the previous results.

You were forcefully brought along to a compatability test
Licca is concerned about the happiness of the God Eaters
who are forced to live on the battlefield. It is exactly because of that
that Licca places her faith on God Arc maintenance and 
link support devices.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0009]
Licca is requesting help for testing the adjusted prototype
after taking onboard the previous results.

According to Licca the final inspection ended in a great success.
If the research and budget gets approval from headquarters,
Licca aims to move the research for the link support device
to the stage where it can be used by the general public.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0009]
After the results from the previous final insepction, 
Licca worked all night on the link support device
and furthered her research.
Head over to Licca to hear what she has to say.

It seems she was finally able to complete
the link support device. It seems that you can
create it at the terminal. Many different variations
have also been prepared. Licca seems to be filled
with pride.
---------------------------------------------------------
[0009]
Before handing in the research documents to HQ R&D department, 
Licca has something she wants you to help with.

Licca recieved a letter from HQ R&D inviting her to work there, 
however she declined the proposal,
and chose to continue working at the Far East Branch of her own
violition.
Filled with a new sense of determination, you could see the spark 
in her eyes.
You feel your bond with Licca has deepened greatly.
