---------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Leah, how are you feeling?<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Leah
---------------------------------------------------------
I'm fine... I remembered various things after that time It 
all became clear to me while we were talking about it.<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Last time you mentioned that, your father was so worried 
that he had Dr. Rachel undergo a dangerous operation or 
something......<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
If you can save someone, you can't just leave them alone 
It's natural that Father didn't have that much of a 
choice<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
He wasn't hesitant at all to help Rachel with founding 
\"Magnolia Compass\" Orphanage, because that's how he 
was......<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Ask Dr. Leah about her father
---------------------------------------------------------
Ask her about \"Magnolia Compass\"
---------------------------------------------------------
Continue
---------------------------------------------------------
It sure is strange... whenever I talk to you guys I get this 
seemingly unbearable feeling in my chest...<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
The things I tried not to think of, maybe now...<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Ask her about her memories with Dr. Rachel
---------------------------------------------------------
Ask her about her family
---------------------------------------------------------
The memories are still vivid in my mind……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
That day, after pushing Rachel down the staircase I kept 
condemning myself……in darkness……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
But the sun will rise again, regardless of anyone's 
will……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
\"The wealthy are obliged to serve humankind's 
future\"…… That was my father's motto……as a 
scientist and a Fenrir executive<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
……Even the God Arc soldiers are my father and us 
siblings' invention as the sword of humankind to bring down 
Aragami without relying on God Eaters……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Us sisters inherited our father's will God Arc soldiers are 
no mere weapon, but what represents our family 
bond……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
I didn't know that your father was an investor…… of 
\"Magnolia Compass\"<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
My bad, we don't mean to demand gratitude from 
you……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
On the contrary, it has been on my mind that I ought to beg 
for your forgiveness Those days in the orphanage must've 
been difficult for you, Ciel……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Leah……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Though, you grew up excellently……Other kids as 
well…… That is my only solace……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
……Now that we mention it, back when I was a child<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
There was one time I remodelled Rachel's wheelchair engines 
they got fast, awfully fast that I ended up getting scolded 
by Father<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
But it was so fun...... Together with Rachel, I drove it 
against the wind and I realized machines can be something 
that makes people happy<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
Me aiming to be a mechanical engineer must be due to that as 
well…… it's already too late, but if I can go 
back……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
My mother was taken by death when we were young, my father 
and my little sister were my whole world But I didn't 
consider myself unfortunate……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
I remember it clearly……When we went on a picnic at 
midnight bringing along sandwiches, in a blooming 
field……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
At that time I told my father……that I'd become a 
scientist Back then, ignorant of everything……I was truly 
happy……<@>
---------------------------------------------------------
